First Repos Bro!

Whats up people?

My name is Kyle and I am new to the whole world of programming. I look foward to learning a lot and using
my knowledge to make software, websites, or anything that comes to my mind. My overall goal is to at some
point do freelance work and incorperate my skills with my passion for music production and come up with
some cool ideas and meet many people along the way.
